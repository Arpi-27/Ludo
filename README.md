# Ludo
The Simple Ludo Game is a fun and interactive application based on the traditional board game Ludo that many people enjoy playing. This project is designed to recreate the basic rules of Ludo in a digital form, allowing players to roll dice, move tokens, and compete to reach the finish point. The game focuses on simplicity so that it is easy to understand and play, even for first-time users.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how game logic works using basic programming concepts. The game begins with players taking turns to roll a virtual dice. Based on the dice value, the player’s token moves forward on the board. The program checks rules such as valid moves, turn order, and winning conditions to ensure fair gameplay.

This project helps learners understand important concepts like random number generation (for dice rolling), conditional statements (for validating moves), loops (for turn-based gameplay), and basic user interaction. Overall, the Simple Ludo Game project combines learning with entertainment and shows how logical thinking can be used to build an engaging game application.
